# Fraud-Detection-Ecommerce

Company ABC is an e-commerce site that sells hand-made clothes.

You have to build a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the site to
perform some illegal activity or not. This is a super common task for data scientists.
You only have information about the user first transaction on the site and based on that you
have to make your classification ("fraud/no fraud").

These are the tasks you are asked to do:
For each user, determine her country based on the numeric IP address.
Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not. Explain how different
assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model
